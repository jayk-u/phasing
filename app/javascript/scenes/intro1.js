"He didnâ€™t follow any pattern, never stopping at anything, killing women, children, the elderly... The victims were all found sliced, cut by what seems to be a large blade, a sword or a saber.",
"But I had something solid. On several TV reports, a man can be seen in the background, hidden in the crowd.",
"After 3 weeks of investigation, I did not have further doubt: this is our man.",
"I have shadowed him ever since, I knew by heart his daily schedule: when he sleeps, when he eats, when he moves.",
"One night, as he went to pick some cigarettes, I took my chances and sneaked into his apartment.",
"Suffice to say I might have underestimated the guy... and the door locked securely after my passage.",
"I felt silly, I felt inadequate. I spent so much time preparing only to fail at the very first step.",
"No more time to look for evidence, this guy is sick. I must get out of here at all costs before he comes back..."
