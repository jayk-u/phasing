# README

Hey guys.

This is Breaking Out!'s team.

This game was originally a two-weeks long end-of-bootcamp project.
The code might not be the most seamless, but it works so oh-well.

We originally only managed to finish a single level, but this is still getting updated.
On the off-chance you don't know, the game can be found at breakingout.xyz .
Should anything freeze or not load for some reason, odds are it'll be better once you refresh the page.

If you find bugs please don't hesitate to contact us (my email: dumontnico5@gmail.com)!
